# js-cardio (Test 2)

Write a function ***f2*** that accepts two arrays of strings, ***a*** and ***b***, as parameters and returns an array, containing for each string in ***b***, how many times it occurs in ***a***

Example:

 - f2([‘aba’, ‘baba’, ‘aba’, ‘xzxb’], [‘aba’, ‘xzxb’, ‘ab’]) returns [2, 1, 0]
	 - ‘aba’ occurs twice, in the first and third string, ‘xzxb’ occurs once in the fourth string, and ‘ab’ does not occur at all
